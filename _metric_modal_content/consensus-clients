## Consensus Client Diversity
---

# What is this metric?

Consensus Client Diversity tracks the breakdown of validators by consensus client. The value of this metric is determined by the combined market share of minority clients. This is specific to Ethereum's Proof of Stake network, also known as the Beacon Chain.

# Why is it important?

Single client dominance creates security and financial risks for that client's node operators and the chain itself. Client dominance puts a disproportionately large group of stakers at risk of being punished for erroneous attestations. A bug in a supermajority client can create potential finality issues for the entire chain, whether that is creating bad blocks or forking the chain.

# How do we improve it?

- **Individuals** - Spread awareness and help educate others about client diversity. Fund minority client teams and projects that promote a multi-client network.
- **Stakers** - Stake with minority clients or join pools that actively diversify their client usage.
- **Governance Entities** - Maintain a reasonable diversity of clients across your pool of validators and support projects that prioritize client diversity. 
- **Developers** - Continually develop and support multiple clients to avoid one or two dominant clients from emerging.
