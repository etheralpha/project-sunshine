# What is this metric?

Execution Client Diversity tracks the breakdown of validators by execution. The value of this metric is determined by the combined market share of minority clients.

# Why is it important?

Single client dominance creates security and financial risks for both that client's node operators and the chain itself. A bug in a supermajority client can create potential finality issues for the entire chain, whether that is creating bad blocks or forking the chain.

# How do we improve it?

- **Individuals** - Spread awareness and help educate others about client diversity. Fund minority client teams and projects that promote a multi-client network.
- **Governance Entities** - Maintain a reasonable diversity of clients across your pool of validators and support projects that prioritize client diversity.
- **Developers** - Continually develop and support multiple clients to avoid one or two dominant clients from emerging.
