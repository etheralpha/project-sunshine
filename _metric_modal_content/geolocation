## Geolocation Diversity
---

# What is this metric?

Geolocation Diversity tracks the counties where validators are operated. The value of this metric is the percentage of validators not operated out of the top validator-populated country.

# Why is it important?

Geolocation diversity helps mitigate the risk of real world factors knocking out large groups of validators at once. Natural disasters and infrastructure failures threaten the uptime of validating hardware. Country policy could reduce the viability of staking or even shut down large groups of stakers. 

# How do we improve it?

- **Individuals** - Spread awareness and help educate others about geolocation diversity. Consider working on projects that bridge the gap between geographical locations or language barriers. 
- **Solo Stakers** - Create hardware fail safes to protect against infrastructure issues. 
- **Pool Stakers** - Stake with a protocol that addresses geolocation issues, such as Rocket Pool. Deposit future ETH into a governance entity that addresses geolocation issues. Write to your current governance entity to express concerns about the security risk of poor geolocation diversity.
- **DAOs** - Become active in advocating for governmental policy that could affect positively affect staking and stake with a protocol with a geolocationally diverse network of validators.
