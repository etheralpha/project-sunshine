## About

Project Sunshine is an Ethereum community initiative to improve decentralization across the entire Ethereum ecosystem by aggregating and displaying decentralization data in an easy-to-interpret manner. The categories for decentralization aren't static, ideally, they'll begin simple and expand to cover many potential centralization metrics. Project sunshine doens't seek to generate primary data feeds, but rather to curate and encourage the development of feeds that are useful in promoting decentralization. We highly value community input and seek to become a visual manifestation of the community's beliefs regarding decentralization.

## Goals and Targets

Each decentralization category is visualized on a spectrum showing red (danger), yellow (caution), and green (good). At this time the gradient is subjective, but is intended to convey the need for action and risk to the network.

## History

The roots of Project Sunshine are based in the willingness of the Ethereum Community's desire to examine existing practice and harden the network through data-driven action. The first realizations regarding the need for decisive action around decentralization came in 2021 when the Prysm beacon chain implementation controlled 70%+ of the validators in a chain architecture that was designed to be multi-client. [Superphiz pushed the community to work toward greater decentrlalization](https://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1437846604707401733) and [hanni_abu](https://twitter.com/hanni_abu) responded by developing [clientdiversity.org](https://clientdiversity.org). A few months later, realizing the need to zoom out from client diversity and focus on ecosystem decentralization, superphiz imagined [project sunshine](https://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1508568072118063109) and Hanni responded to the call by assembling a team in the Ether Alpha discord and beginning work.

## Future

Project sunshine seeks to be a community driven decentralization dashboard to support continual hardening of the the Ethereum network. We actively seek to include third party data sources and contributors to site development. Project Sunshine is teaming up with [GitPOAP](https://gitpoap.io) to recognize and reward contributors who make this dashboard possible.

## Other contributions

Project sunshine relies on the desire of the Etheruem community to decentralize and improve our ecosystem. Having data isn't enough, but it offers a starting point. Use the data from Project Sunshine to guide conversations about the next steps. What can individuals and responsible companies do to improve our network?
